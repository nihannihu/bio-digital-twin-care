Due to these guidances, use of these drugs in children has decreased significantly in the US and some other countries, but continues in some clinical settings. Some advocate for careful genotype-guided use of codeine in specific pediatric patient populations.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The US FDA label includes a warning to mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended when taking codeine (...). Codeine and its metabolites, including morphine, are secreted into human breast milk. The amount is typically low and dose-dependent, but breastfeeding women with a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype may achieve high serum concentrations of morphine on standard codeine therapy. This may lead to high levels of morphine in breast milk and dangerously high morphine exposure in their breastfed infants. A fatal opioid poisoning in a breastfed neonate from an ultrarapid metabolizer mother receiving codeine has been described; however a more recent review of this case calls into question the plausibility of neonatal opioid toxicity from breastfeeding. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology provides clinical guidance for postpartum pain management as untreated or inadequately treated pain in lactating women also has adverse consequences for the postpartum mother and her breastfed infant.</li>\n</ul>\n",

CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table, CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diplotypes giving rise to activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer assignments.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> Because the recommendations in this guideline do not differ between a CYP2D6 normal and intermediate metabolizer, the current published recommendations for normal and intermediate metabolizers will remain unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower value of 0.25 for *10). Prior to the consensus projects, the combination of a duplicated normal function allele with a *10 allele resulted in an activity score of 2.5 which translates to an ultrarapid metabolizer. The lower value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10 results in an activity score of 2.25 for these allele combinations, which based on the consensus project translates to a normal metabolizer.

Literature up to August 2013 was reviewed. <strong>The update addresses the FDA warning regarding codeine use in children following tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, pediatric considerations, and additional considerations for use of alternative opioids metabolized by CYP2D6</strong>. In addition, supplemental information was updated.</li>\n<li>Excerpts from the 2014 guideline update:\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em>CYP2D6</em> genotype is expected to be equally reliable for inferring phenotype from genotype in children as in adults. Codeine is not recommended in children less than 2 years of age but presumably would carry additional dangers in neonates and young children who are ultrarapid metabolizers.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Caution should be used when prescribing codeine to a breastfeeding woman with an ultrarapid metabolizer status.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;In February 2013, the FDA announced its strongest and new black box warning against codeine use to manage postoperative pain in children following tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. This warning was in response to further FDA review of the codeine-related deaths and serious adverse drug reactions. The FDA warning is applicable to all children undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy irrespective of their obstructive sleep apnea status or CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These guidelines are applicable to:\n<ul>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/codeine/2014/24458010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype and codeine therapy: 2014 Update </a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/codeine/2014/24458010-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">Gene-Specific Information Tables for CYP2D6</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-codeine-by-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of codeine by CYP2D6 Phenotype</h4>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2014 guideline update manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Likely phenotype.<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Activity score</th>\n<th>Genotypes</th>\n<th>Examples of diplotypes</th>\n<th>Implications for codeine metabolism</th>\n<th>Recommendations for codeine therapy.<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Classification of recommendation for codeine therapy</th>\n<th>Considerations for alternative opioids</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultrarapid metabolizer (~1-2% of patients)</td>\n<td>&gt;2.0</td>\n<td>An individual carrying more than two copies of functional alleles</td>\n<td>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN</td>\n<td>Increased formation of morphine following codeine administration, leading to higher risk of toxicity</td>\n<td>Avoid codeine use due to potential for toxicity.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>Alternatives that are not affected by this CYP2D6 phenotype include morphine and non-opioid analgesics.

Classifying patients with an activity score of 1.0 as extensive metabolizers in this guideline is based on data specific for formation of morphine from codeine in these patients [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/19395173\">19395173</a>].</p>\n<p><sup>d</sup> There is substantial evidence for decreased efficacy of tramadol in poor metabolizers and a single case report of toxicity in an ultrarapid metabolizer with renal impairment following tramadol post-surgery.  Use of other analgesics in CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers may therefore be preferable (see 2014 update above).</p>\n<p><sup>e</sup> Some other opioid analgesics are metabolized by CYP2D6, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. To avoid treatment complications, opioids that are not metabolized by CYP2D6, including morphine, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone and hydromorphone, along with non-opioid analgesics, may be considered as alternatives for use in CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"february-2012\">February 2012</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication Dec 2011.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for codeine were published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">(CPIC)</a>.</li>\n<li>These guidelines are applicable to:\n<ul>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/codeine/2012/22205192.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guidelines for Codeine Therapy in the Context of Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) Genotype</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/codeine/2012/22205192-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2012 supplement</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
