CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table and the CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diplotypes giving rise to activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer assignments.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> The recommendation for CYP2D6 IM (reduce starting dose by 25%) should be considered for CYP2D6 AS of 1 (strength of recommendation: optional). The authors of this guideline are in the process of updating this guideline to reflect this change and evaluate new evidence since the publication of this guideline.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower activity value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10). See <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> Prior to the consensus projects, the combination of a duplicated normal function allele with a CYP2D6*10 allele resulted in an activity score of 2.5 which translates to an ultrarapid metabolizer. The lower value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10 results in an activity score of 2.25 for these allele combinations, which based on the consensus project translates to a normal metabolizer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"december-2016-update\">December 2016 Update</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication December 2016.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2016 update of CPIC guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">(CPIC)</a>.

However, the results of these studies may apply to other TCAs because these drugs have comparable pharmacokinetic properties.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;There is substantial evidence linking <em>CYP2D6</em> genotypes to phenotypic variability in tricyclic side-effect and pharmacokinetic profiles. Modifying pharmacotherapy for patients who have <em>CYP2D6</em> genomic variants that affect drug efficacy and safety could potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce the failure rate of initial treatment.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot; There are scarce studies focusing solely on <em>CYP2D6</em> genotype and association with pharmacokinetic parameters or treatment outcomes of TCAs in pediatric patients. CYP2D6 activity is fully mature by early childhood, but CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults.
