To address this, CPIC updated the allele definition and functionality tables to include the c.1129-5923C&gt;G SNP separately as this is likely the causal variant leading to decreased function. CPIC also retained the HapB3 haplotype definition for cases where only the c.1236G&gt;A variant is tested (e.g. whole exome sequencing). While CPIC recommends to directly test the causal SNP if possible, in cases where only c.1236G&gt;A is tested or results are available for, it should be clearly stated in the test report that “decreased function” was inferred by detecting the exonic tag SNP, and disclose that in rare cases, the causal decreased function variant c.1129-5923C&gt;G may not be present despite having this tag SNP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A recent publication [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/37639651\">37639651</a>] reported evidence for a potentially reduced treatment effectiveness in DPYD c.1236G&gt;A (HapB3) carriers receiving fluoropyrimidine dosing reduced by 25%. In the same patient group, also significantly increased toxicity was observed. The guideline authors have reviewed this paper and concluded that further studies need to be performed before potentially changing the dosing recommendation for this risk variant. It was noted that in this study, in the majority of patients receiving genotype-based dose reductions, no dose escalation was performed as is recommended in the CPIC guideline. Given this evidence for substantial interpatient variability among heterozygous carriers of a single decreased function variant (activity score 1.5), particular emphasis should be placed on dose titration after the initial dosing in this patient group. This guideline is in the process of being updated and these recommendations will be reviewed based on a complete evidence review.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"november-2018-update\">November 2018 Update</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The DPYD guideline published in November 2017 recommended to reduce the dose of fluoropyrimidines by 25-50% (from the full standard dose) in DPYD Intermediate Metabolizers with an activity score of 1.5. At the time of the guideline publication, this dose range was recommended due to limited evidence for genotype-guided dosing of decreased function alleles/variants. However, a recent prospective study [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/30348537\">30348537</a>] provides evidence to support a recommendation for a 50% dose reduction in heterozygous carriers of the decreased function variants c.2846A&gt;T (<a href=\"/variant/PA166153895\">rs67376798</a>) or c.1129–5923C&gt;G (<a href=\"/variant/PA166153906\">rs75017182</a>); HapB3 or its tagging SNP c.1236G&gt;A; <a href=\"/variant/PA166153889\">rs56038477</a>). These data suggest that all Intermediate Metabolizers with an activity score of 1.5 should receive a 50% dose reduction. <strong>Therefore CPIC revised its recommendation such that all DPYD Intermediate Metabolizers should receive a 50% dose reduction from the full standard starting dose, whether the activity score is 1 or 1.5 followed by dose titration, based on clinical judgement and ideally therapeutic drug monitoring.</strong></li>\n<li>In addition, recent case reports from patients who are homozygous for c.2846A&gt;T (activity score of 1) indicate that a dose reduction of more than 50% may be required in some carriers of this genotype. <strong>Therefore, in patients with an activity score of 1 due to a homozygous c.[2846A&gt;T];[2846A&gt;T] genotype, clinicians should be aware that a &gt;50% reduction in starting dose might be warranted.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"november-2017-update\">November 2017 Update</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication November 2017</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2017 update of CPIC guidelines regarding 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine has been accepted for publication in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.
