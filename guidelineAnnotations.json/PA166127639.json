Literature pertaining to sertraline and <em>CYP2C19</em>  published between January 2015 to June 2022 was reviewed and the recommendations and supplemental information were updated. Additionally, literature pertaining to <em>CYP2B6</em> and sertraline published up to June 2022 was evaluated.</li>\n<li>Excerpts from the guideline:\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Because CPIC recommendations are provided with the assumption that the test results are available prior to prescribing, we have provided recommendations when only CYP2C19 or only CYP2B6 are available, or when both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 genotype results are available.  Although a change in dose or therapy may not be warranted based on results for a single gene, treatment modification may be warranted given the combination of a non-normal CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 phenotype. Dosing recommendations for CYPC19/CYP2B6 and sertraline are based on Braten. et al and are based on the reported or calculated percentage differences in exposure from normal metabolizers (44).&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This guideline is applicable to:\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; Guideline for for <em>CYP2D6</em>, <em>CYP2C19</em>, <em>CYP2B6</em>, <em>SLC6A4</em>, and <em>HTR2A</em> Genotypes and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2023 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials\">CYP2C19 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2b6RefMaterials\">CYP2B6 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/sertraline-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Sertraline Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/sertraline_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Sertraline Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Sertraline_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Sertraline CDS Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-sertraline-based-on-cyp2c19-phenotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for sertraline based on CYP2C19 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 3b of the guideline.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Genotypes</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic<br/>Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of<br/>Recommendations<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 Ultrarapid Metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two increased function alleles.</td>\n<td>*17/*17</td>\n<td>Small increase in metabolism of sertraline to less active compounds when compared to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers.</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>CYP2B6 metabolizer status, drug-drug interactions, and other patient characteristics (e.g., age, renal function, liver function) should also be considered.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 Rapid Metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying one normal function allele and one increased function allele.</td>\n<td>*1/*17</td>\n<td>Small increase in metabolism of sertraline to less active compounds when compared to normal metabolizers.</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>CYP2B6 metabolizer status, drug-drug interactions, and other patient characteristics (e.g., age, renal function, liver function) should also be considered.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 Normal Metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying two normal function alleles.</td>\n<td>*1/*1</td>\n<td>Normal metabolism</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>CYP2B6 metabolizer status, drug-drug interactions, and other patient characteristics (e.g., age, renal function, liver function) should also be considered.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2C19 Likely Intermediate Metabolizer</td>\n<td>An individual carrying one normal function allele and one decreased <sup>b</sup> function allele or one increased function allele and one decreased <sup>b</sup> function allele or two decreased <sup>b</sup> function alleles.</td>\n<td>*1/*9, *9/*17, *9/*9</td>\n<td>Reduced metabolism of sertraline to less active compounds when compared to CYP2C19 normal metabolizers.</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.

Therefore, in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers a dose reduction of 50% is recommended or an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 should be considered.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The recommendations in the guideline and below apply primarily to actions based on genetic tests only; drug interactions and other clinical factors can have a major influence for prescribing decisions for SSRIs and should be taken into consideration before initiating drug therapy.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Data describing the relationship between CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotype and SSRI systemic exposure or steady state plasma concentrations in pediatric patients are scarce...CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults; therefore, these recommendations should be used with caution in children and accompanied by close monitoring.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/SSRI/2015/25974703.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/SSRI/2015/25974703-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials\">CYP2C19 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/SSRI/2015/Sertraline_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Sertraline Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/SSRI/2015/Sertraline_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts_and_Flow_Chart.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Sertraline Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-sertraline-based-on-cyp2c19-phenotype-1\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for sertraline based on CYP2C19 phenotype:</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 3b of the 2015 guideline manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Likely phenotype</th>\n<th>Genotypes</th>\n<th>Examples of CYP2C19 diplotypes</th>\n<th>Implications for sertraline metabolism</th>\n<th>Therapeutic Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations <sup>a</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultrarapid metabolizer (~5-30% of patients) <sup>b</sup></td>\n<td>An individual carrying two increased function alleles or one normal function allele and one increased function allele</td>\n<td>*17/*17, *1/*17</td>\n<td>Increased metabolism when compared to extensive metabolizers.</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.
