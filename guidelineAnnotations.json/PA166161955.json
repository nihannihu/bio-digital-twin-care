CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table, CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diplotypes giving rise to activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer assignments.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> Because the recommendations in this guideline do not differ between a CYP2D6 normal and intermediate metabolizer, the current published recommendations for normal and intermediate metabolizers will remain unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower value of 0.25 for *10). Prior to the consensus projects, the combination of a duplicated normal function allele with a *10 allele resulted in an activity score of 2.5 which translates to an ultrarapid metabolizer. The lower value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10 results in an activity score of 2.25 for these allele combinations, which based on the consensus project translates to a normal metabolizer.

This translates clinically into a decreased response to ondansetron and tropisetron, specifically increased risk of vomiting in CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. If CYP2D6 genotype is known, alternative 5-HT3 receptor antagonist antiemetics not metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., granisetron) should be considered in CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. &quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;At the time of this writing, there are no data available on CYP2D6 genotype's effect on ondansetron or tropisetron response in the pediatric populations, although there is no reason to suspect that <em>CYP2D6</em> genetic variation will affect this drug's metabolism differently in children compared with adults. Because CYP2D6 catalytic activity in neonates (&lt;1 month old) depends strongly on developmental aspects, the impact of CYP2D6 in this patient population might be different than adults or older children.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:</li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/ondansetron/2016/28002639.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guideline for CYP2D6 Genotype and Use of Ondansetron and Tropisetron</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/ondansetron/2016/28002639-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2016 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for CYP2D6</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/tropisetron-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tropisetron Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/tropisetron_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tropisetron Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Tropisetron_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tropisetron Clinical Decision Support Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-tropisetron-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype-genotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for tropisetron based on CYP2D6 phenotype/genotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2016 guideline manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>CYP2D6 Phenotype</th>\n<th>Activity score</th>\n<th>CYP2D6 Genotypes<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Examples of diplotypes</th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of Recommendations<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Consideration for alternative 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists antiemetics<sup>c</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2.0</td>\n<td>An individual carrying duplications of function alleles</td>\n<td><em>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN</em><sup>d</sup></td>\n<td>Increased metabolism to less active compounds when compared to normal metabolizers and is associated with decreased response to ondansetron and tropisetron (i.e. vomiting).</td>\n<td>Select and alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 (i.e. granisetron).<sup>e</sup></td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Dolasetron, palonosetron, and ramosetron are also metabolized by CYP2D6.
