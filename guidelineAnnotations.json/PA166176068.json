CPIC recently conducted a modified-Delphi project to obtain consensus for a uniform system for translating CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype among a panel of international CYP2D6 experts <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cpicpgx.org/resources/cyp2d6-genotype-to-phenotype-standardization-project/\" target=\"_blank\">more information</a>. Modifications to CPIC’s prior system include downgrading the value assigned to the CYP2D6*10 allele for activity score calculation from 0.5 to 0.25 and changing the phenotype assignment for an activity score of 1 from normal metabolizer to intermediate metabolizer (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://files.cpicpgx.org/data/gene/CYP2D6/Inferred_CYP2D6_Phenotype10242019.docx\" target=\"_blank\">table of all previous and new phenotype groupings</a>).</p>\n<p>As a result, the following changes have been made in the CYP2D6 allele functionality table, CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype table, Tamoxifen pre- and post-test alerts and flow chart (access tables below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activity scores of 1 changed from CYP2D6 normal metabolizer to CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on the recommendations in this guideline:</strong> The current guideline has a specific recommendation for AS of 1 (no CYP2D6*10 allele present); thus, the current published recommendations for normal and intermediate metabolizer will remain unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All activity scores for diplotypes containing a CYP2D6*10 allele have been updated accordingly (activity scores changed to reflect the lower activity value of 0.25 for CYP2D6*10).

The evidence was considered uniformly strong that CYP2D6 PMs (AS=0) have lower plasma endoxifen concentrations among patients taking adjuvant tamoxifen compared to CYP2D6 NMs, and that reduced CYP2D6 activity (AS=0 to 1) is associated with lower plasma endoxifen concentrations among patients taking adjuvant tamoxifen compared to normal CYP2D6 activity.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Because of the extensive biological variability across the various clinical settings where tamoxifen is administered  (prevention, ductal carcinoma in situ, premenopausal and postmenopausal adjuvant setting, and metastatic), the current CPIC guidelines focuses only on the role of CYP2D6 genotype in the adjuvant treatment of ER+  breast cancer, using the endpoints of recurrence, recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, breast cancer specific survival, and overall survival.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;CYP2D6 UMs and NMs are expected to achieve therapeutic endoxifen concentrations after administration of tamoxifen and should receive the recommended standard of care doses of tamoxifen. CYP2D6 PMs and IMs (including patients with an activity score of 1.0, see below) are expected to have lower endoxifen concentrations compared to NMs and have a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence, and worse event-free survival compared to NMs.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;For CYP2D6 PMs, a “strong” therapeutic recommendation was provided to recommend alternative hormonal therapy such as an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for postmenopausal women or aromatase inhibitor along with ovarian function suppression in premenopausal women given that these approaches are superior to tamoxifen regardless of CYP2D6 genotype [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/26211827\">26211827</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/24881463\">24881463</a>] and based on knowledge that CYP2D6 PMs patients who switch from tamoxifen to anastrozole do not exhibit an increased risk of recurrence [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/23213055\">23213055</a>]. Given that escalation of tamoxifen dose from 20-40 mg/day in CYP2D6 PM significantly increases endoxifen concentrations (but not to concentrations achieved in CYP2D6 NMs [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/27226358\">27226358</a>]), the use of an aromatase inhibitor (+/- ovarian function suppression) is recommended in this setting. Tamoxifen 40 mg/day can be considered for CYP2D6 PM if there are contraindications to AI use.</li>\n<li>&quot;For CYP2D6 IMs and CYP2D6*10/*10 or CYP2D6*10/decreased function allele, a “moderate” recommendation was made to consider use of an alternative hormonal therapy (i.e. aromatase inhibitor) for postmenopausal women or aromatase inhibitor plus ovarian function suppression in premenopausal women is recommended. In CYP2D6 IMs, if aromatase inhibitors are contraindicated, consideration can be given for the use of a higher FDA-approved dose of tamoxifen (40 mg/day), which is known to result in significantly higher endoxifen concentrations without an increase in toxicity [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/27226358\">27226358</a>]. Based on extrapolation from evidence in *10 individuals, a similar recommendation applies to individuals who carry other decreased function alleles resulting in an activity score of 1.0 but with an “optional” recommendation, given the paucity of data for this group.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/tamoxifen/2017/29385237.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guideline for CYP2D6 and Tamoxifen Therapy</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/tamoxifen/2017/29385237-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for CYP2D6</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/tamoxifen-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tamoxifen Drug Resource Mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/tamoxifen_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tamoxifen Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Tamoxifen_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tamoxifen Clinical Decision Support Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-tamoxifen-by-cyp2d6-genotype-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of tamoxifen by CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype.</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2017 guideline manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Activity Score</th>\n<th>Genotype</th>\n<th>Examples of genotypes<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic recommendations<sup>c</sup></th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations<sup>d</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>CYP2D6</em> Ultrarapid Metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2</td>\n<td>An individual carrying duplications of functional alleles</td>\n<td>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN<sup>e</sup></td>\n<td>Therapeutic endoxifen concentrations</td>\n<td>Avoid moderate and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.

In contrast, prescribing recommendations for those with an activity score of 1 based on the presence of CYP2D6 alleles other than *10 are graded as “optional” because the recommendations are primarily extrapolated from evidence generated from *10 individuals (i.e. limited data for clinical outcomes and pharmacokinetics for this group).<br />\n<sup>d</sup> Rating scheme described in Supplement.<br />\n<sup>e</sup> Where xN represents the number of CYP2D6 gene copies.
