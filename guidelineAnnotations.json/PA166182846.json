This is because *5 was reported to be reduced or fully functional depending on the drug. However, more recent data indicate full functionality of *5 for all drugs. It has therefore been decided to abolish the separate contraindications for patients with *5 in six months’ time. Healthcare providers should therefore match patients currently linked to CYP2B6 *1/*5 or CYP2B6 *5/*5 to CYP2B6 NORMAL METABOLISER (NM) and patients currently linked to CYP2B6 *5/*6 OR *5/*18 have been linked to CYP2B6 INTERMEDIATE METABOLISER (IM).&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"may-2021-update\">May 2021 Update</h3>\n<p>The Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association - Pharmacogenetics Working Group has updated their therapeutic dose recommendations for efavirenz based on CYP2B6 genotype.
