However, because there is not enough evidence to reject the warnings and recommendations in the SmPC either, the KNMP decided to adopt the genotyping recommendation in the SmPC. The SmPC indicates that genotyping must be performed before starting siponimod to guide drug and dose selection. This would amount to genotyping being essential for drug safety according to the nomenclature of the KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/page/dpwgPreemptiveGenotyping\">Read more about how DPWG assigns their recommendations for preemptive genotyping.</a></p>\n",
