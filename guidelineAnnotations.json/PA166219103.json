Higher exposure of PPIs has also been associated with adverse effects, as has long-term use.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;The RM and UM phenotypes are driven by the presence of the increased function CYP2C19*17 allele. Due to the relatively recent discovery of this variant and because the majority of studies describing associations between CYP2C19 genotype, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PPIs were conducted in Asian populations in whom the CYP2C19*17 allele occurs less frequently, there are limited data on the relationship between CYP2C19*17, pharmacokinetic parameters, acid secretion indices and therapeutic outcomes in CYP2C19 RMs and UMs.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;Nevertheless, the low PPI exposure documented in patients who are CYP2C19 UMs compared to NMs, IMs, and PMs suggests that these individuals may benefit from higher than standard daily doses of PPIs (Tables S1-S3).&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot; While CYP2C19 NMs are expected to have normal PPI metabolism and clearance, a large body of literature from studies in Asian populations reported an association between CYP2C19 NMs and decreased therapeutic effectiveness with these PPIs (e.g., failure to eradicate H. pylori infection and lower healing rates of erosive esophagitis) compared to CYP2C19 IMs and PMs (Tables S1-S4). Therefore, for CYP2C19 NMs, initiating these PPIs at standard daily doses (e.g., label recommended doses) is generally recommended; however, for H. pylori infection or erosive esophagitis, clinicians may consider increasing the recommended dose for these indications by 50-100% to optimize therapeutic efficacy.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;CYP2C19 IMs and PMs are considered to be “therapeutically advantaged” compared to NMs in terms of efficacy. However, it has been suggested that continued inhibition of acid secretion in individuals taking PPIs chronically who are genotyped as CYP2C19 IMs or PMs may have a higher risk of PPI-related adverse events compared to NM, RM, or UM phenotypes. While the current data are insufficient to make strong dosing recommendations, potential associations of CYP2C19 phenotype and incidence of adverse events (e.g., infections) are emerging.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<em><strong>Pediatrics</strong></em>: The CYP2C19-guided PPI recommendations presented in Table 2 also apply to pediatric patients. ......
