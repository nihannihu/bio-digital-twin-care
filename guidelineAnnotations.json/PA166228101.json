Due to these guidances, use of these drugs in children has decreased\nsignificantly in the US and some other countries, but continues in some clinical settings.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The US FDA label includes a warning to mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended when taking (...) tramadol. (...) the warning for tramadol was extrapolated from presence of tramadol and its active metabolite in breast milk and the evidence for adverse events in adults who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (...). Our evidence review did not identify any published cases or studies related to adverse events due to infant exposure to tramadol in breast milk. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology provides clinical guidance for postpartum pain management as untreated or inadequately treated pain in lactating women also has adverse consequences for the postpartum mother and her breastfed infant.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n",

A label recommended starting dosing is also recommended for intermediate metabolizers; these patients should be monitored closely for less than optimal response and should be offered an alternative analgesic if warranted.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, current evidence supports the avoidance of (...) tramadol and the use of an alternative analgesics due to the likelihood of suboptimal or lack of effect. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to recommend a higher dose of (...) tramadol in poor metabolizers, especially considering the evidence that some adverse events do not differ between poor and normal metabolizers.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;For CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers, (...) tramadol should not be used, in order to avoid the risk of severe toxicity with label-recommended dosing. Non-opioid analgesics and if needed, other opioids that are not affected by CYP2D6 phenotype, are potential alternatives for use in CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers based on the type, severity and chronicity of the pain being treated.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/opioids/2020/33387367.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; Guideline for Opioids and <em>CYP2D6</em>, <em>OPRM1</em> and <em>COMT</em></a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/opioids/2020/33387367-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2020 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">CYP2D6 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/tramadol-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tramadol Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/tramadol_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Tramadol Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Tramadol_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tramadol Clinical Decision Support Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-tramadol-therapy-recommendations-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Tramadol therapy recommendations based on CYP2D6 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 3 of the guideline.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Activity score<br/>range</th>\n<th>Activity score<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Examples of<br/><em>CYP2D6</em> diplotypes<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of<br/>recommendation<sup>d</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td><em>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN<sup>c</sup></em></td>\n<td>Increased formation of O-desmethyltramadol (active metabolite) leading to higher risk of toxicity.</td>\n<td>Avoid tramadol use because of potential for toxicity.
