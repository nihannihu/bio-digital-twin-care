Carbamazepine carries a 10-fold higher risk of SJS/TEN for these patients and is therefore not an alternative. A comparable risk has been reported for lamotrigine as for phenytoin.

The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group considers genotyping of patients of Asian descent other than Japanese or Korean descent before starting phenytoin to be beneficial for drug safety. It is advised to genotype these patients before (or directly after) drug therapy has been initiated to guide drug and dose selection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/page/dpwgPreemptiveGenotyping\">Read more about how DPWG assigns their recommendations for preemptive genotyping.</a></p>\n",
