The risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in these patients is 1.8-7.7%.</td>\n<td>- Avoid carbamazepine.<br/>- Phenytoin, lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine also pose an increased risk of SJS/TEN in these patients, but the final risk is 5–10-fold lower for these medicines than for carbamazepine. Furthermore, in the case of oxcarbazepine, the most severe forms (SJS/TEN overlap and TEN) have not been observed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HLA-B*1511 positive</td>\n<td>The risk of the life-threatening cutaneous side effect Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in the first three months is increased in patients with this genetic variation. The risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele, which carries a 1.6-9.9 times higher risk than the HLA-B*1511 allele, is 1.8-7.7%. This would equate to a risk of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in this patient of 0.18-4.8%.</td>\n<td>- Carefully weigh the risk of SJS/TEN against the benefits<br/>- Avoid carbamazepine if an alternative is possible.<br/>- If it is not possible to avoid carbamazepine, advise the patient to report any skin rash immediately.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Clinical Implication Score for HLA-B*15:02-carbamazepine is “essential” in patients of Asian descent other than Japanese descent, based on the criteria and corresponding scores, but the <strong>genotyping recommendation is downgraded to “beneficial”</strong> by the DPWG due to additional considerations.
