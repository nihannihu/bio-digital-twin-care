In these patients, phenytoin and lamotrigine carry a similar risk of SJS/TEN as oxcarbazepine, but more severe forms of SJS/TEN (SJS/TEN overlap and TEN) are also observed with these medicines. Therefore, they are also not suitable as alternatives.<br/>- If it is not possible to avoid oxcarbazepine, advise the patient to report any rash immediately.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a download=\"DPWG_HLA_oxcarbazepine_6931.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/DPWG_HLA_oxcarbazepine_6931.pdf\">Read for more information about this recommendation</a>, <a download=\"HLAs.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/HLAs.pdf\">Read about gene information from DPWG</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"preemptive-genotyping\">Preemptive genotyping</h4>\n<p>Excerpts from the <a download=\"DPWG_HLA_oxcarbazepine_6931.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/DPWG_HLA_oxcarbazepine_6931.pdf\">DPWG risk analysis document</a> for oxcarbazepine and HLA:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>HLA-B*1502 has not been detected in a sample of 1350 Dutch persons (Allele Frequency Net Database:\nhttp://www.allelefrequencies.net). For this reason, the KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group does not consider\ngenotyping of Dutch patients in general before starting oxcarbazepine to be useful.\nHowever, the HLA-B*1502 frequency is high in Asians, except for Japanese and Koreans. In Japanese the HLAB*1502 frequency is very low (&lt; 0.1%). In Korea, it is less than 1% in some populations and more than 1% in other\npopulations, with a mean of approximately 2% according to the SmPC of carbamazepine. The KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group considers genotyping of patients of Asian descent other than Japanese descent before starting oxcarbazepine to be beneficial for drug safety. It is advised to consider genotyping these patients before (or\ndirectly after) drug therapy has been initiated to guide drug selection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/page/dpwgPreemptiveGenotyping\">Read more about how DPWG assigns their recommendations for preemptive genotyping.</a></p>\n",
