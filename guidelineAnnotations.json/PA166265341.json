Based on the estimated risk for all patients and the increase by a factor 2.4-7.9 for patients with this genetic variation, the risk of lamotrigine-induced SJS/TEN in patients with HLA-B*1502 is estimated at 0.24-0.79%.</td>\n<td>- Carefully weigh the risk of SJS/TEN against the benefits.<br/>- Avoid lamotrigine if an alternative is possible. Carbamazepine carries a much higher risk of SJS/TEN in these patients and is therefore not an alternative. A similar risk has been reported for phenytoin as for lamotrigine. The same applies to oxcarbazepine, but the most severe forms (SJS/TEN overlap and TEN) have not been observed with oxcarbazepine.<br/>- If it is not possible to avoid lamotrigine, advise the patient to report any skin rash immediately.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a download=\"DPWG_HLA_lamotrigine_6932.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/DPWG_HLA_lamotrigine_6932.pdf\">Read for more information about this recommendation</a>, <a download=\"HLAs.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/HLAs.pdf\">Read about gene information from DPWG</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"preemptive-genotyping\">Preemptive genotyping</h4>\n<p>Excerpts from the <a download=\"DPWG_HLA_lamotrigine_6932.pdf\" href=\"https://api.clinpgx.org/v1/download/file/attachment/DPWG_HLA_lamotrigine_6932.pdf\">DPWG risk analysis document</a> for lamotrigine and HLA:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>HLA-B*1502 has not been detected in a sample of 1350 Dutch persons (Allele Frequency Net Database:\nhttp://www.allelefrequencies.net). For this reason, the KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group does not consider\ngenotyping of Dutch patients in general before starting lamotrigine to be useful.\nHowever, the HLA-B*1502 frequency is high in Asians, except for Japanese and Koreans. In Japanese the HLAB*1502 frequency is very low (&lt; 0.1%). In Korea, it is less than 1% in some populations and more than 1% in other\npopulations, with a mean of approximately 2% according to the SmPC of carbamazepine. The KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group considers genotyping of patients of Asian descent other than Japanese descent before\nstarting lamotrigine to be beneficial for drug safety. It is advised to consider genotyping these patients before (or\ndirectly after) drug therapy has been initiated to guide drug selection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/page/dpwgPreemptiveGenotyping\">Read more about how DPWG assigns their recommendations for preemptive genotyping.</a></p>\n",
