As part of this guideline, the authors classified drugs by their risk of causing acute hemolytic anemia (AHA) in patients with G6PD deficiency. Nitrofurantoin has been classified as a <strong>medium risk drug</strong>, as shown in Table 2 of the guideline publication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These guidelines are applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpts from the guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;An additional step was added to this CPIC guideline to assign drugs into three groups: those that can be considered high risk for AHA in the presence of G6PD deficiency (and thus should generally be avoided), those that are considered medium risk in G6PD deficiency (and thus should be used with caution), and those that can be considered low-to-no risk (with no added risk of AHA in those that are deficient for G6PD versus those with normal G6PD status).&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;In order to assign drugs into risk groups, the authors considered not only the strength of the evidence in the primary peer-reviewed literature, but also the frequency of drug use, the presence of regulatory agency warnings, and the presence or absence of a mechanism by which\nreactive oxygen species might be generated and contribute to hemolysis in G6PD deficiency (Supplement, Assigning Risk Level)&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>Risk category for nitrofurantoin in G6PD deficiency.</strong></em> Nitrofurantoin is considered in the medium risk category because although the evidence from primary literature linking it to AHA is moderate at best, there have been relatively strong long-standing regulatory warnings that may have hindered its use in G6PD deficient patients (Table S3).&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"
