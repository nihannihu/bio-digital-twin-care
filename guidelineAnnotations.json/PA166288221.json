Those with undetectable or low plasma concentrations had a lower probability of clinical benefit, although the minimal effective paroxetine therapeutic concentration is not well-defined (36). Because of the decreased probability of clinical benefit due to lower drug exposure for paroxetine and vortioxetine, an alternative antidepressant not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 should be considered.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;When administered similar doses, CYP2D6 PMs had significantly greater drug exposure or parent to metabolite ratios for paroxetine, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine when compared to NMs (Table S1). Increased drug exposure increases the risk for dose/concentration-dependent side effects. To potentially prevent  adverse effects, dose extrapolations based on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between phenotype groups suggest a 50% dose reduction of paroxetine (Table 2a) and vortioxetine (Table 2d) and a 30% dose reduction of fluvoxamine is warranted (27).&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The FDA Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations lists venlafaxine and vortioxetine as drugs warranting dose adjustments in CYP2D6 PMs.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CPIC&reg; Guideline for for <em>CYP2D6</em>, <em>CYP2C19</em>, <em>CYP2B6</em>, <em>SLC6A4</em>, and <em>HTR2A</em> Genotypes and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2023 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">CYP2D6 Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/vortioxetine-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Vortioxetine Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/vortioxetine_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Vortioxetine Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/images/flow_chart/Vortioxetine_CDS_Flow_Chart.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Vortioxetine CDS Flow Chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-vortioxetine-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for vortioxetine based on CYP2D6 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2d of the guideline.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype</th>\n<th>Activity score<br/>range</th>\n<th>Activity score</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Implications</th>\n<th>Therapeutic<br/>Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of<br/>recommendation<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td><em>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN<sup>c</sup></em></td>\n<td>Increased metabolism of vortioxetine to inactive compounds when compared to CYP2D6 normal metabolizers.
