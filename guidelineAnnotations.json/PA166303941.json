Genetic cascade testing may be sufficient to determine the MHS status of relatives. However, there is some controversy regarding the risk status of individuals who test negative for the familial variant. In addition, the complementary roles of IVCT or CHCT and genetic testing are not fully determined. These issues should be addressed in each family by an expert in the genetics of MHS. Triggering agents are relatively contraindicated (i.e., these agents should almost never be used) in all patients with MHS, regardless of age.&quot;</p>\n",

CPIC has added an additional 291 variants and updated the allele definition, frequency, and functionality tables accordingly (additional details can be found in the notes tab of the RYR1 allele functionality table, see <a href=\"/page/ryr1RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for RYR1</a>). Additionally, CPIC has created RYR1 and CACNA1S diplotype to phenotype tables. See the notes tab in the supporting files and the <a href=\"https://blog.clinpgx.org/ghost/#/site\">blogpost</a> for mappings from pathogenicity terms to CPIC terms, and details of diplotypes in the case of &gt;2 RYR1 variants found.</p>\n<h3 id=\"july-2023-update\">July 2023 update</h3>\n<p>As part of the Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility VCEP two-year variant review, c.1589G&gt;A (R530H) is now classified as Likely Pathogenic and c.14582G&gt;A (R4861H) is now classified as VUS. Based on this classification, the assignment for the variant c.1589G&gt;A has been changed from &quot;uncertain function&quot; to “malignant hyperthermia-associated” and for the variant c.14582G&gt;A from “malignant hyperthermia-associated” to “uncertain function” in the RYR1 allele functionality table. Additional variants beyond these 44 have been identified by the VCEP and the current CPIC authors are reviewing these variants for inclusion in the CPIC tables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"november-2021-update\">November 2021 update</h3>\n<p>Subsequent to the publication of the CPIC guideline for RYR1 and malignant hyperthermia [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/30499100\">30499100</a>], the ClinGen variant curation expert panel (VCEP) developed and published recommendations for RYR1 pathogenicity classifications in malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. These revised ACMG/AMP criteria were applied to the 44 variants originally included in the CPIC recommendations and 29 variants were classified as pathogenic, 13 as likely pathogenic, and 2 as variants of uncertain significance [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/33767344\">33767344</a>]. Based on this classification, the assignment for the variants c.1589G&gt;A p.(Arg530His) and c.1598G&gt;A p.(Arg533His) has been changed from “malignant hyperthermia-associated” to “uncertain function” in the RYR1 allele functionality table. Additional variants beyond these 44 have been identified by the VCEP and the current CPIC authors are reviewing these variants for inclusion in the CPIC tables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"september-2019-update\">September 2019 update</h3>\n<p>The published version of this article included a typographical error in Table 1 and in the supplemental tables: RYR1 c.488G&gt;A should instead be listed as RYR1 c.488G&gt;T. The Table 1 in guideline, RYR1 allele definition table, RYR1 allele functionality table, and RYR1 frequency table have been updated accordingly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"november-2018\">November 2018</h3>\n<p><em>Advance online publication November 2018</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CPIC guidelines regarding the use of potent volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine in the context of <em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> genotypes is published in <em>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</em> by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).</li>\n<li>Excerpts from the 2018 dosing guideline:\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;The diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is made by one of two criteria: (a) positive response to an in vitro muscle bioassay, such as the in vitro contracture test (IVCT), or the caffeine-halothane contracture test (CHCT) as it is known in the United States; or (b) the presence of a pathogenic variant in <em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> found by molecular genetic testing.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;MHS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and a heterozygous genotype of a pathogenic variant in <em>RYR1</em> can be considered as diagnostic of the trait.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The guidelines focus on the clinical utility of the identification of variants in these genes in individuals without a personal or family history of a reaction to these drugs or agents.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The literature review focused on 48 <em>RYR1</em> and 2 <em>CACNA1S</em> variants accepted as ‘diagnostic mutations’ by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG).&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;The lack of inclusion of a variant in this guideline should not be interpreted to mean that we have judged them to be benign.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;A result that is negative, or a result that detects a variant that is not among the 50 listed here, is more difficult to interpret....The interpretation of a negative genetic testing result in an at-risk individual who is related to a person with MHS and a pathogenic variant is complex and controversial and is outside the scope of this recommendation.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;An individual negative for an <em>RYR1</em>- or <em>CACNA1S</em>-associated malignant hyperthermia ‘diagnostic mutation’ as designated by the EMHG, should be considered to have uncertain susceptibility. A negative result does not eliminate the chance that this patient is susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;There is less experience with MHS in children as compared to adults, but unpublished observations suggest that the risk of an MH reaction may be higher when an anesthetic is administered in childhood. The identification of a causative variant associated with MHS in a parent should lead to complete evaluation of all at risk family members, including children.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/2018/30499100.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for the use of potent volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine in the context of <em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> genotypes</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/2018/30499100-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2018 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/ryr1RefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for RYR1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cacna1sRefMaterials\">Gene-specific Information Tables for CACNA1S</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Desflurane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Desflurane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Enflurane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Enflurane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Halothane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Halothane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Isoflurane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Isoflurane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Methoxyflurane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Methoxyflurane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Sevoflurane_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Sevoflurane drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/Succinylcholine_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Succinylcholine drug resource mapping</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/volatile_anesthetic_agents_succinylcholine_pre_and_post_test_alerts_and_flow_chart.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine pre and post test alerts and flow chart</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommendations-for-inhaled-anesthetics-or-succinylcholine-in-the-context-of-ryr1-or-cacna1s-genotypes\">Table 1: Recommendations for inhaled anesthetics or succinylcholine in the context of <em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> genotypes.</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2018 guideline manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> phenotype</th>\n<th>Genotype</th>\n<th>Example Variants</th>\n<th>Implications for phenotypic measures</th>\n<th>Dosing recommendations for inhaled anesthetics or succinylcholine</th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations<sup>a</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Malignant Hyperthermia susceptible</td>\n<td>An individual heterozygous<sup>b</sup> for a <em>RYR1</em> or <em>CACNA1S</em> malignant hyperthermia causative variant as designated by the EMHG <sup>c,d,e</sup></td>\n<td><em>RYR1</em> c.103T&gt;C;
