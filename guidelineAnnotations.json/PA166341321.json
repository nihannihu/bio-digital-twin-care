Therefore, it may be reasonable to assume that the pharmacokinetic effects of CYP2D6 variation would affect clinical metoprolol response similarly across a variety of indications, and the dosing recommendations provided could be utilized for most cardiovascular indications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Recommendations primarily focus on minimizing the risk of adverse effects in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers related to the greater observed reductions in heart rate and blood pressure stemming from increased metoprolol systemic exposure. In addition, the maximally tolerated metoprolol dose may be lower in poor metabolizers compared to normal metabolizers due to these pharmacokinetic differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>While the evidence suggests metoprolol plasma concentrations are also increased in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers compared with normal metabolizers, these effects appear smaller in magnitude than those observed with poor metabolizers, and there was insufficient evidence to clarify whether these smaller pharmacokinetic differences significantly affect clinical response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers experience clinically significant differences in metoprolol exposure or response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Importantly, none of the recommendations provided in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would prevent or impede the up-titration of beta-blocker doses to maximally tolerated or guideline-recommended levels, such as in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and in the post-myocardial infarction setting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Download and read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/beta_blockers/2024/38951961.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Guideline publication</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/beta_blockers/2024/38951961-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Guideline supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">Gene-Specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/drug_resource/metoprolol-Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/report/current/test_alert/metoprolol_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Pre and Post Test Alerts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-therapeutic-use-of-metoprolol-in-relation-to-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended therapeutic use of metoprolol in relation to CYP2D6 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the guideline</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phenotype<sup>a</sup></th>\n<th>Activity score range</th>\n<th>Activity score<sup>b</sup></th>\n<th>Examples of CYP2D6 diplotypes<sup>c</sup></th>\n<th>Implications<sup>d</sup></th>\n<th>Recommendations</th>\n<th>Classification of recommendations<sup>e</sup></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultrarapid metabolizer</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td>&gt;2.25</td>\n<td>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN, *2/*2xN</td>\n<td>Increased metabolism of metoprolol leading to decreased drug concentrations; however, it is unclear whether this results in clinically significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or clinical outcomes.</td>\n<td>No recommendation for metoprolol therapy due to insufficient evidence regarding diminished metoprolol effectiveness clinically</td>\n<td>No recommendation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal metabolizer</td>\n<td>1.25 ≤ x ≤ 2.25</td>\n<td>2.25<br/>2<br/>1.75<br/>1.5<br/>1.25</td>\n<td>*2x2*10<br/>*1/*1, *1/*2<br/>*1/*10x3<br/>*1/*17, *2/*29<br/>*1/*10, *1/*41, *1/*9</td>\n<td>Normal metabolism of metoprolol</td>\n<td>Initiate standard dosing</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermediate metabolizer</td>\n<td>0 &lt; x &lt; 1.25</td>\n<td>1<br/>0.75<br/>0.5<br/>0.25</td>\n<td>*1/*5<br/>*10/*17, *29/*41<br/>*10/*10, *41/*41, *10/*41<br/>*4/*10, *4/*41</td>\n<td>Decreased metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased drug concentrations; however, this does not appear to translate into clinically significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or clinical outcomes</td>\n<td>Initiate standard dosing</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poor metabolizer</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*3/*4, *4/*4, *5/*5, *5/*6</td>\n<td>Decreased metabolism of metoprolol leading to markedly increased drug concentrations; this leads to greater heart rate and blood pressure reductions, but the effect on clinical outcomes is unclear</td>\n<td>Initiate therapy with lowest recommended starting dose.
