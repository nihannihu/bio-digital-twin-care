      "summary" : "Mavacamten, the first drug in the class of beta-cardiac myosin modulator, is used for the treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This orally administered drug demonstrates wide interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics parameters, due in part to variant CYP2C19 alleles. Individuals who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers have increased exposure and are at increased risk of reduced cardiac hypercontractility. To ensure the safety of all patients, European Medicines Agency recommends CYP2C19 preemptive genotyping, and consecutively, to adapt maintenance and initial mavacamten doses, and to manage drug-drug interactions, according to CYP2C19 phenotype. In this article, we summarize evidence from the literature supporting the association between CYP2C19 phenotype and pharmacological features of mavacamten and provide, beyond biologic guidelines, therapeutic recommendations for the use of mavacamten based on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/CYP3A5 genotype.",

This work is\nbased on a scientific review of literature on mavacamten clinical\ntrials, pharmacological, and genetic studies, and on the Clinical\nPharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) data for\nCYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 haplotypes definitions, alleles\nfrequencies and functional impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>After analyzing the available data, RNPGx recommends genotyping for clinical use both null alleles CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3\nbefore initiating mavacamten treatment, for every ethnicities.\nThese alleles are associated with poor metabolizer status for the\nCYP2C19, in order to limit mavacamten overexposure and ensure\npatient safety (Figure 3 and Table 5). These two-­ star alleles are\nthe own with enough level of evidence: functional, clinical, and\nare recommended by the EMA.\nThe “advisable” and “possibly helpful” tests cannot currently be used\nto guide mavacamten treatment due to the lack of clinical evidence.\nHowever, further studies are needed, as some functional or pharmacokinetic data suggest a potential impact in certain situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tables 1-4 give drug-drug interaction adjustments based on metabolizer status (not reproduced here).
