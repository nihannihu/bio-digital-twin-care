In two studies, discontinuation rates of 60% and 63% were observed (compared with discontinuation rates of 5% and 19% for patients without this gene variation). The gene variation potentiates the atazanavir-induced reduction in bilirubin conversion, leading to a higher risk of the benign side effects jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia.</td>\n<td>- avoid atazanavir if there is a suitable alternative<br/>- if there is no suitable alternative:<br/>- tell the patient that jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia are benign, i.e. not indicative of liver damage, and that they are reversible even after long-term use of atazanavir<br/>- tell the patient what the disadvantages of the possible alternatives are</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UGT1A1*1/*28</td>\n<td>atazanavir</td>\n<td>This gene variation (*1/*28) is more common in Western populations than the so-called wild type (*1/*1).
