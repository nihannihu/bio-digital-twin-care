      "summary" : "Hydralazine is a vasodilator typically used in the treatment of resistant hypertension and heart failure. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) catalyzes the metabolism of hydralazine into inactive metabolites. NAT2 poor metabolizers (historically referred to as \"slow acetylators\") are predicted to have increased plasma hydralazine concentrations compared with NAT2 rapid and intermediate metabolizers (historically referred to as \"rapid acetylators\" and \"intermediate acetylators,\" respectively), which may lead to both increased clinical efficacy and adverse effects, including drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus. This guideline summarizes the evidence from the literature relevant to NAT2/hydralazine and provides recommendations for hydralazine prescribing based on NAT2 genotype-predicted acetylator phenotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).",

Consequently, the writing committee, with input from the broader CPIC membership, ultimately resolved that neither metabolizer phenotype would be classified as normal due to the even global split and extensive use of the historical terms that do not include the term “normal.” In addition, because all phenotypes are actionable for hydralazine prescribing, future clinical decision support may alert providers for rapid or intermediate metabolizers prescribed low doses and for slow metabolizers prescribed high doses.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Most studies exploring the relationship between NAT2 genetic variation and oral hydralazine involve phenotyping, as they were conducted before genotyping technologies were readily available for scientific research.
