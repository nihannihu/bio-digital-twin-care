In addition, the\nClinical Implication Score is mainly (for 80%) based on studies published in medical journals and therefore not\nsuited to determine the clinical implication for gene-drug interactions for which data are only provided by pre-regis-\ntration studies. For these reasons, the KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group decided to ignore the Clinical\nImplication Score and adopt the genotyping recommendation in the SmPC. The SmPC indicates that genotyping\nmust be performed before starting mavacamten to guide dose selection. This would amount to genotyping being\nessential for drug safety according to the nomenclature of the KNMP Pharmacogenetics Working Group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/page/dpwgPreemptiveGenotyping\">Read more about how DPWG assigns their recommendations for preemptive genotyping.</a></p>\n",
