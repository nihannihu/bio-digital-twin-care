      "summary" : "HLA molecules play a central role in the adaptive immune response. Their high polymorphism influences individual susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases and certain drug-induced hypersensitivities. In France, HLA genotyping is classified as a medical genetics procedure and is strictly regulated. The Société Francophone d'Histocompatibilité et d'Immunogénétique (SFHI) has established national guidelines outlining clinically validated indications, required resolution levels and interpretation criteria based on robust data. These guidelines are particularly relevant for common clinical contexts, including autoimmune diseases and pharmacogenetic testing. Well-established associations include HLA-DQB1*02/DQA1*05 (DQ2) and HLA-DQB1*03:02/DQA1*05 (DQ8) with celiac disease, HLA-B*27 with spondyloarthritis, HLA-DQB1*06:02 with type 1 narcolepsy, HLA-A*29 with Birdshot chorioretinopathy and several pharmacogenetic risk alleles such as HLA-B*57:01 (abacavir), HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 (carbamazepine) and HLA-B*58:01 (allopurinol). In immunotherapy, the efficacy of tebentafusp has been shown to depend on HLA-A*02:01 positivity. HLA alleles must be interpreted as relative risk factors, not absolute predictors. Critical analysis of HLA-related scientific literature requires consideration of the genotyping technique, typing resolution, allele frequencies within the studied population and environmental factors. High-resolution typing is essential in pharmacogenetics and recommended in selected autoimmune disorders. Interpretation should be conducted by qualified medical biologists, integrating clinical context, allelic diversity and recent technological advances, particularly next-generation sequencing. HLA genotyping represents a valuable tool in diagnosis and risk assessment, with increasing importance in the era of personalised medicine.",

This constitutes the molecular mechanism underlying the HSR. HLA-B*57:01 screening is therefore mandatory prior to treatment initiation. If the allele is present(i.e., the test is positive), abacavir is strictly contraindicated. Re-exposure or reintroduction is strictly forbidden due to the high risk of severe recurrence, with mortality rates reported as high as 35%.</p>\n<p>HLA-B*57:03 is a closely related allele to HLA-B*57:01, both classified within the B57 serological group. Despite high sequence similarity, critical amino acid differences in the peptide-binding groove result in distinct immunological properties. Unlike HLA-B*57:01, HLA-B*57:03 is not linked to abacavir hypersensitivity due to its inability to bind abacavir within the peptide-binding cleft in the same manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
